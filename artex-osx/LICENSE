NOTICE

ARTexplorer Native (artex-osx) is a Rust/Metal macOS application for exploring
polyhedral geometry in Quadray ABCD coordinates using Rational Trigonometry.
It is owned by OpenBuilding, Inc., a nonprofit registered in Canada, supported
by the Ontario Association of Architects.

This software implements original research combining:
- R. Buckminster Fuller's Synergetics (tetrahedral coordinate geometry)
- N.J. Wildberger's Rational Trigonometry (algebraic, not transcendental)
- Tom Ace's Quadray coordinate system
- Kirby Urner's Python explorations connecting these traditions

The RT-pure geometry engine (rt_math/, rt_polyhedra/) and the Quadray-native
rendering pipeline represent original work by Andy Ross Thomson, M.Arch. OAA.

Unauthorized modification, redistribution, or misrepresentation of this work
is not permitted. Please refer to this LICENSE file for details, or contact
us directly with questions.

NOTE ON GAME FUNCTIONALITY

Game-related modules and functionality (when implemented) may be subject to
additional licensing restrictions beyond CC BY-NC-ND 4.0. These restrictions
will be documented separately when game features are released.

THIRD-PARTY ATTRIBUTION

This application uses the following open-source libraries:
- wgpu (Apache 2.0 / MIT) — GPU abstraction layer
- winit (Apache 2.0 / MIT) — window management
- egui (Apache 2.0 / MIT) — immediate-mode GUI
- glam (Apache 2.0 / MIT) — camera matrices (rendering boundary only)
- bytemuck (Apache 2.0 / MIT / Zlib) — safe transmutation for GPU buffers

Camera orbit technique uses conventional yaw/pitch with glam quaternions.
Future versions will replace this with Quadray Rotor orientation (RT-pure).
