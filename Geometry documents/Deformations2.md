# Deformations v2 - Implementation Roadmap

## Quick Start for New Agent

**Branch**: `DEFORM` (created from `main` at `af25fcd`)
**Status**: Phase 0 complete, Phase 1 skipped, ready for Phase 2
**Goal**: Enable vertex-level editing of Line primitives

### Current State (Jan 28, 2026 - Late Night)
- ✅ **Phase 0: Multi-Select** - COMPLETED (`d5e48a0`)
- ⏭️ **Phase 1: Grouping** - SKIPPED (multi-select provides sufficient functionality)
- ⚠️ **Phase 2: Line Deformation** - PARTIAL SUCCESS, reconsidering approach
- 💡 **Alternative: Point-Based Lines** - Recommended new approach (see below)

**Phase 2 Status**:
- Edge and nodes move during drag (works!)
- lineWeight=1 now default for deform compatibility
- BUT: mouse up doesn't exit (only ESC), subsequent edits delete nodes
- Orphaned vertex nodes appear in space disconnected from rendered line
- Complex code (~470 lines in rt-deform.js) for fragile results

### Key Files to Modify
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `modules/rt-init.js` | Add deform mode handlers, keyboard shortcuts |
| `modules/rt-state-manager.js` | Add selection state, deformation data structure |
| `modules/rt-rendering.js` | Add `updateLineGeometry()` function |
| `index.html` | Buttons already in place (lines 1820-1867) |
| `modules/rt-context.js` | Action handlers already in place (lines 144-180) |

### ⚠️ Critical Architecture Note
**rt-init.js is 4,648 lines** - avoid adding significant code here. Any new feature requiring >50 lines should be extracted to a separate module. See `JAN28-EXTRACT.md` for candidates.

## Implementation Order (Prerequisites First)

### Phase 0: Multi-Select ✅ COMPLETED
**Commit**: `d5e48a0` - "Feat: Add multi-select support (Phase 0 for Deform)"

**Implementation**:
- Extended selection state in rt-state-manager.js with `objects[]` array
- Added helper methods: `addToSelection()`, `removeFromSelection()`, `isSelected()`, `getSelectedObjects()`, `getSelectionCount()`, `clearSelection()`
- Modified `selectPolyhedron()` in rt-init.js to accept `addToSelection` parameter
- Added Shift+click behavior to toggle selection
- Added selection count UI in Edit Actions section

**Selection state** (rt-state-manager.js):
```javascript
selection: {
  type: null,           // 'form' or 'instance'
  id: null,             // Instance ID
  object: null,         // THREE.Object3D reference (primary selection)
  objects: [],          // Multi-select array
  mode: 'object',       // 'object' | 'vertex' | 'edge' | 'face'
  subSelection: {
    vertices: [],       // Array of selected vertex indices
    edges: [],          // Array of selected edge indices
    faces: []           // Array of selected face indices
  }
}
```

**Bonus**: Move and Rotate tools work with multi-select out of the box!

### Phase 1: Grouping ⏭️ SKIPPED
**Decision**: Skip formal grouping for now. Multi-select already provides group-like behavior for transforms.

**Why skipped (Jan 28, 2026)**:
1. Multi-select + transform tools already provide core "group" behavior
2. Implementation attempt revealed issues: cursor feedback, selection consistency, editing basis positioning
3. Adding ~200 lines to rt-init.js (already 4,648 lines) was unacceptable
4. Grouping adds no value over multi-select until we need hierarchical transforms

**Future consideration**: If we need persistent groups (parent-child hierarchy), implement as a separate module with proper state management.

### Phase 2: Line Deformation (Thin Lines Only) ⚠️ PARTIAL

**Commits**: `5de61af`, `4905e54`

**What Works**:
- ✅ lineWeight=1 now default (uses LineSegments, not Line2)
- ✅ D key and Deform button enter deform mode
- ✅ Green vertex nodes appear at line endpoints
- ✅ Click node → turns yellow (selected)
- ✅ Drag node → edge follows in real-time
- ✅ ESC exits deform mode

**What Doesn't Work**:
- ❌ Mouse up doesn't complete the operation (must press ESC)
- ❌ Subsequent edits delete one of the vertex nodes
- ❌ Orphaned vertex nodes appear disconnected from rendered line
- ❌ ~470 lines of complex code for fragile results

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The current approach fights the existing architecture:
1. Line instances clone geometry separately from the state-managed Point nodes
2. The deform code must track and update multiple objects (LineSegments, vertex Meshes)
3. Proximity matching between nodes is fragile and accumulates errors
4. No constraint system to keep edge connected to endpoints

---

## 💡 Alternative Approach: Point-Based Lines (RECOMMENDED)

### Key Insight
**Points already work perfectly** with:
- StateManager (create, select, move, delete)
- FileHandler (export, import)
- All snap modes (vertex, edge, face, object)
- All edit commands (move, rotate, scale)

**A Line is fundamentally two Points connected by an edge.**

### Proposed Architecture

Instead of complex deform code, leverage existing infrastructure:

```javascript
// A Line is defined by references to two Point instances
line.userData.connections = {
  startPoint: pointInstanceId1,  // Reference to Point instance
  endPoint: pointInstanceId2     // Reference to Point instance
};

// When a Point moves, any connected Lines update automatically
RTStateManager.updateConnectedGeometry(pointInstance);
```

### Benefits

1. **No Deform Mode Needed** - Just move the Points normally
2. **Reuses Proven Code** - Points already work with all systems
3. **Natural Extensibility** - Connect 3+ points → polygon, connect faces → polyhedra
4. **Constraint-Based** - Line edge always follows its endpoints
5. **Less Code** - Remove rt-deform.js, add ~50 lines for connection tracking

### Implementation Plan

**Phase 2A: CONNECT Feature**
1. Select two Point instances (using multi-select)
2. Press "Connect" button or 'C' key
3. Creates a Line instance that references both Points
4. Line edge renders between Point positions

**Phase 2B: Automatic Updates**
1. When a Point moves, find all Lines that reference it
2. Update those Line geometries to match new Point positions
3. No special "deform mode" - just normal move operations

**Phase 2C: Visual Feedback**
1. When Line is selected, highlight connected Points
2. Optionally show "connection lines" during hover

### Research Needed
- THREE.js constraints (may not need - just update on move)
- How to store Point→Line relationships efficiently
- Whether to allow "orphan" Lines (not connected to Points)

---

### Phase 2 Original Approach (DEPRECATED)

**Key Discovery from Previous Attempt**:
> Line2 from three/addons uses **Mesh** internally, not Line objects.
> When lineWidth > 1, Line2 creates a triangular prism (Mesh) to simulate thick lines.

**Tasks (mostly done but fragile)**:
- [x] Force LineSegments (not Line2) for Line primitives during deform
- [ ] Add `deformation` field to instance schema
- [x] Implement `enterDeformMode()` / `exitDeformMode()`
- [x] Vertex node click detection (raycast to meshes with `isVertexNode`)
- [x] Drag handling with offset calculation
- [x] `updateLineGeometry()` to update edge + nodes
- [x] Wire Deform button and 'D' keyboard shortcut

### Phase 3: Line2 Support (Thick Lines)
**After thin lines work**, add Line2 handling:

```javascript
// Clone Line2 at object level, not children
if (child.isLine2) {
  const clone = child.clone();
  clone.geometry = child.geometry.clone();
  clone.material = child.material.clone();
  target.add(clone);
}

// Update Line2 geometry
if (child.isLine2) {
  child.geometry.setPositions([v0.x, v0.y, v0.z, v1.x, v1.y, v1.z]);
  child.computeLineDistances();
}
```

### Phase 4: Polygon Deformation
Extend to n-gon polygons (multiple vertices, edges update automatically).

### Phase 5: Polyhedra Deformation
Full 3D: vertices shared across faces, all incident geometry updates.

## Lessons Learned

### From UI-TWEAKS-J28 Branch (Earlier Deform Attempt)

**What Went Wrong**:
1. **Jumped straight to deform** without multi-select infrastructure
2. **Didn't understand Line2 structure** - spent cycles debugging wrong object types
3. **Too many code changes at once** - hard to isolate issues

**What the Logs Revealed**:
```
[Deform] updateLineGeometry called. Group children:
  - type=Group, constructor=Group, isLine2=undefined
  - type=Mesh, constructor=Mesh, isMesh=true  (x4)
[Deform] No edge geometry found to update!
```

The instance had 4 Meshes (2 vertex nodes + 2 Line2 internal prism meshes) but NO Line2/LineSegments object. The edge we saw was from the **Form**, not the **Instance**.

### Line2 Technical Details

**Line2 internal structure**:
- Line2 object has `isLine2 = true`
- But Line2's **children** are regular Meshes (triangular prism geometry)
- Checking `child.isLine2` on traversed children returns `undefined`

**Correct approach for Line2**:
- Check for Line2 at the **group level** before traversing
- Clone Line2 as a unit, not its internal meshes
- Update via `line2.geometry.setPositions()` not position attributes

### From DEFORM Branch Phase 1 (Grouping Attempt - Jan 28, 2026)

**What Went Wrong**:
1. **Grouping didn't add value over multi-select** - Move/Rotate already worked with multiple selections
2. **Too much code in rt-init.js** - Adding ~200 lines pushed file past 4,800 lines
3. **Multiple bugs appeared**: cursor stuck as pointer, individual items could be deselected from group, editing basis appeared at wrong position, Group button didn't toggle to Ungroup
4. **Scope isolation issues** - Similar problems to previous rt-controls.js extraction failures

**Key Insight**: Multi-select with existing transform tools provides 90% of grouping functionality without any new code. Formal grouping only needed for persistent parent-child hierarchies.

**Code Quality Principle**: "Move slowly and don't break things. Clean, minimal, modular code." Large files like rt-init.js (4,648 lines) need extraction, not expansion.

## Deformation Data Structure

```javascript
instance.deformation = {
  vertices: [
    { index: 0, offset: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 } },
    { index: 1, offset: { x: 0.5, y: 0, z: 0 } }
  ],
  originalVertices: [
    { x: 0, y: 0, z: -0.5 },
    { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.5 }
  ]
}
```

Benefits:
- Non-destructive (original geometry preserved)
- Easy undo/redo (modify offsets)
- Clean serialization for export/import

---

## UI Elements Already in Place

### index.html (Controls section ~line 1820-1867)
- Edit Actions: Deform button, Group button (disabled stubs)
- History: Undo button, Redo button (disabled stubs)

### rt-context.js (lines 144-180)
- `action === "deform"` → calls `window.enterDeformMode()`
- `action === "group"` → logs stub message
- `action === "undo"` → calls `window.RTStateManager?.undo()`
- `action === "redo"` → calls `window.RTStateManager?.redo()`

---

## Testing Checklist

### Phase 0: Multi-Select ✅ PASSED
- [x] Click object A → selected
- [x] Shift+click object B → both selected
- [x] Shift+click object A → deselected, only B remains
- [x] Visual feedback shows all selected objects
- [x] Move tool works with multi-select
- [x] Rotate tool works with multi-select

### Phase 1: Grouping ⏭️ SKIPPED
(Multi-select provides equivalent functionality)

### Phase 2: Line Deformation (Current Approach - Partial)
- [x] Create Line primitive (lineWidth = 1) - now default
- [x] Deposit instance with NOW
- [x] Select instance
- [x] Click Deform button → mode enters, nodes become selectable
- [x] Click vertex node → node highlights yellow
- [x] Drag vertex → edge follows, other vertex stays fixed
- [ ] Release → position persists ❌ (requires ESC, subsequent edits break)
- [x] ESC → exit deform mode
- [ ] Export/Import → deformation preserved (not tested)

### Phase 2A: Point-Based Lines (Recommended Alternative)
- [ ] CONNECT feature: select 2 Points → create Line between them
- [ ] Line stores references to Point instances
- [ ] Moving Points automatically updates connected Lines
- [ ] No deform mode needed - just use normal Move tool

## Appendix: Why Point-Based Approach is Superior

### Current Line Implementation Issues

1. **Lines have their own vertex nodes** - duplicates Point functionality
2. **Cloning creates disconnected copies** - geometry diverges from visual nodes
3. **Deform code must track multiple objects** - LineSegments + vertex Meshes
4. **Proximity matching is fragile** - errors accumulate with each edit
5. **No constraint system** - edge and nodes can desync

### Point Implementation Already Handles

1. **Creation** - Single node at position, works with all tools
2. **Selection** - Click to select, Shift+click for multi-select
3. **Movement** - Gumball, snap to vertex/edge/face/object
4. **StateManager** - Tracked as instance, undo/redo ready
5. **FileHandler** - Export/import preserves position
6. **Rendering** - Node size options (Sm/Md/Lg/Packed)

### A Line = Two Connected Points

Instead of:
```
Line Instance
├── Mesh (vertex node 0)
├── LineSegments (edge)
└── Mesh (vertex node 1)
```

Use:
```
Point Instance A (existing, proven)
Point Instance B (existing, proven)
Line Instance
└── LineSegments (edge, positions derived from A & B)
    └── userData.connections = { start: A.id, end: B.id }
```

When Point A moves → Line automatically updates edge start position.
When Point B moves → Line automatically updates edge end position.

**No deform mode needed. No special code. Just move Points.**
